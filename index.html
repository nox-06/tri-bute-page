        <h3>Early life and Education</h3>
            <p>Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar was born on October 19, 1910 in Lahore, British India. (Lahore is now in Pakistan.)</p>
            <p>He was the third of ten children in a well-educated family: his mother was a translator, who taught her children to read, while his father was Deputy Auditor General of the Northwestern Railways. The Nobel Prize winning physicist C. V. Raman was his father’s brother. As a young boy, he was home-schooled by his parents and private tutors.</p>
            <p>In 1922, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar became a student at the Hindu High School, Triplicane, Madras, where he was educated until 1925. Then, aged just 14, he began studying for a physics degree at Presidency College, also in Madras. (The city of Madras is now known as Chennai.)</p>
            <p>In 1929, aged 18, he wrote his first academic paper, The Compton Scattering and the New Statistics. The following year, he graduated with a B.Sc. Honors degree in physics.</p>
    
        <h3>Cambridge and Europe</h3>
            <p>Chandrasekhar had already been identified as having extraordinary potential in physics; as a result of this he was awarded a scholarship to study for a Ph.D. degree at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom.</p>
            <p>His supervisor at Cambridge was the physicist and astronomer Ralph Fowler. While traveling by ship from India to Britain in 1930, Chandrasekhar reviewed Fowler’s and others’ work on the degenerate electron gas in white dwarf stars. He updated the classical physics used previously to understand the behavior of the electrons, incorporating the new relativistic physics of Albert Einstein.</p>
            <p>Although he was just 19 when he did it this work, it led to his Nobel Prize in physics. In 1931, Chandrasekhar visited Göttingen, Germany, where he had been invited to spend summer working with the future Nobel Prize winning physicist Max Born. In 1932, Chandrasekhar moved again, this time to Copenhagen, Denmark where he worked at the Institute for Theoretical Physics, founded 12 years earlier by Nobel Prize winning physicist Niels Bohr.</p>
            <p>In 1933, he returned to Cambridge, where at the age of 22 he received his Ph.D. degree. He was also awarded a Fellowship to continue research at Cambridge for four more years.</p>
    
        <h3><br>Astrophysics Research</br>
            'The Chandrasekhar Limit and the Fate of Stars'
        </h3>
            <p>Between the ages of 18 and 28 (1929 to 1939) Chandrasekhar was intensely interested in the physics of stars – astrophysics.Traveling by ship in 1930 to begin his Ph.D. at Cambridge, he calculated a number. In his honor this number is now called The Chandrasekhar Limit. Its value is 1.4.This number determines the fate of stars. Chandrasekhar published his result in 1931 in the Astrophysical Journal.</p>
            <p>In several billion years, our sun will become a white dwarf. In 1930, astrophysicists believed all stars would eventually fade to become white dwarfs.Chandrasekhar discovered that a white dwarf can exist only if its mass is less than or equal to 1.4 times our sun’s mass. Chandrasekhar initially found the limit would be about 1.7 solar masses, but over time, he refined this value.At the end of a star’s life, if its remaining mass is greater than 1.4 times our sun’s mass, then its ultimate fate will be rather strange.</p>

        <h3>The Nobel Prize</h3>
            <p>In the end, scientists came to accept that Chandrasekhar was correct, and Eddington was wrong. It was a slow process, taking about 30 years.It is now accepted that the ultimate fate of stars depends on their masses. Smaller stars become white dwarfs, while larger stars, after a supernova, can become neutron stars or black holes.In 1983, Chandrasekhar was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics “for his theoretical studies of the physical processes of importance to the structure and evolution of the stars.” He shared the prize with William Fowler.</p>
    
        <h3>The End</h3>
            <p>Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar died of a heart attack on August 21, 1995, aged 84. He had retired from his role as a full professor at the University of Chicago in 1980. He continued living in Chicago and his output of scientific books continued.His final book was Newton’s Principia for the Common Reader, a masterpiece published shortly before his death.He was survived by his wife Lalitha, who died in 2013 at the age of 102.Today, NASA’s Chandra X-ray observatory, named in his honor, orbits the earth. This observatory has lived up to its name, discovering new black holes, new supermassive black holes, and a new class of black hole.</p>
